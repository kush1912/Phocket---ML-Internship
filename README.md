*1 Designing the preprocessing template*
+It was able to load the dataset on its own
+Fill the missing values using final methods and the techniques you have used to fill them.
+Using standard scalar functions to standardize the attributes of the column
+One hot encoding of categorical features so that they could be sent to the algorithmic models which use numerical models to build the model.

*2: Design a template which identifies the most important independent features in the dataset.*

Used the above mentioned preprocessing template to preprocess the data which
way shows the utility of in work
BLACK FRIDAY DATASET was used as reference-One of the very popular datasets which
is highly skewed and have categorical attributes as input independent features and
continuous output
Designed a template which splits the data on the wer input biased ratio and then trains
and tests the model have used 6 different algorithms to train the model and compare
the results
Thave also applied PCA and derived 4 principal components and trained and tested the
model

3. Evaluation Of Classification model
Analysis of ROC Curve
Finding when the model is being going through overfitting and when the model is being
underfitted
ROC curve also helps us in finding out the effect of different hyper parameters used in
the algorithms
currency of the model has significant role but that just can't be the only parameters to
analyte the utility of our model
ealth data set was used as a reference.
